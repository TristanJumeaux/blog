As a MMA fan, I love to watch fights during my free time.
What I especially like to do is to chose a fighter and watch all his fights from the start to the end of his career.

However, the platform that I use to do this, the UFC fight pass, doesn't offer this feature. When you search for a fighter, you just have all his fights without any particular order or temporality.

Hence, I decided to build this little project !
